# README

This is an application built with Ruby on Rails and React that allows the user to search twitter handles and displays a list of that user's most recent tweets. I provided some custom validation to prevent it from erroring out on bad or empty requests. The display list is a React component and I brought in Bootstrap 4 for styling. I utilized RoR authentication in the controller for all search requests. 

Using ruby v 2.4.2 and rails v 5.2.0
Twitter is integrated via gem <a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/twitter"> twitter</a> 
React is intgrated via <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails"> react-rails</a>
