This is an application built with Ruby on Rails and React that allows the user to search twitter handles and then display a list of that user's most recent tweets. I provided validation to prevent the application from erroring out on bad or empty requests. The tweets list is two React components with Bootstrap 4 included for styling. Mentions in tweets will link to that user's pages within my application, this is done via a regular expression on the front-end and logic in the controller to remove characters that shouldn't be there.


Using ruby v 2.4.2 and rails v 5.2.0
Twitter is integrated via <a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/twitter"> twitter</a> gem
